# Maxwell Mean Sort

**Maxwell Mean Sort** is a high-performance hybrid sorting algorithm created by **Jace Maxwell Horner**. Implemented in C and callable via Python, it uses adaptive mean-based partitioning, a manual stack to avoid recursion, and insertion sort for small ranges. It consistently outperforms Python’s built-in TimSort and Quicksort in real-world benchmarks across all tested input sizes.

## 📊 Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm         | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Maxwell Mean** | O(n)       | O(n log n)    | O(n²)       | O(log n)         |
| TimSort (Python) | O(n)       | O(n log n)    | O(n log n)  | O(n)             |
| Quicksort (Py)   | O(n log n) | O(n log n)    | O(n²)       | O(log n)         |

> Maxwell Mean achieves **O(n)** best-case performance on sorted or nearly sorted arrays, with efficient manual stack partitioning.  
> Its **average-case** performance is solidly **O(n log n)**, while it avoids recursion depth issues by using an explicit stack.  
> **Worst-case O(n²)** behavior may occur in highly skewed distributions, but is rare in practice.

## ⚙️ How It Works

**Maxwell Mean Sort** combines classic partitioning with adaptive strategies for real-world performance. Here's the step-by-step behavior:

1. **Manual Stack Initialization**  
   - Avoids recursion by using a custom stack for managing subarray ranges. Starts with the full array.

2. **Loop Until Sorted**  
   - Continues processing while the stack has unsorted ranges.

3. **Use Insertion Sort for Small Segments**  
   - For ranges with ≤50 elements, insertion sort is applied (faster for tiny partitions).

4. **Compute the Mean**  
   - The pivot is the arithmetic mean of all values in the current segment.

5. **Partition Around Mean**  
   - All elements ≤ mean go to the left, > mean go to the right (in-place partitioning).

6. **Push Subranges Back on Stack**  
   - After partitioning, left and right subsegments are pushed to be sorted in future iterations.

7. **Repeat**  
   - The process continues until all segments are sorted.

This hybrid approach is both space-efficient and practical for large-scale use.

Original array:
[81, 14, 3, 94, 35, 31, 28, 17, 94, 13, 86, 94, 69, 11, 75]

Step 1: Partition entire array around mean (pivot = 49.67)
→ [11, 14, 3, 13, 35, 31, 28, 17, 94, 94, 86, 94, 69, 81, 75]

Step 2: Partition left segment [11, 14, 3, 13, 35, 31, 28, 17] around mean (pivot = 19.00)
→ [11, 14, 3, 13, 17, 31, 28, 35]

  ▸ Insertion sort (0–4): [3, 11, 13, 14, 17]  
  ▸ Insertion sort (5–7): [28, 31, 35]

Step 3: Partition right segment [94, 94, 86, 94, 69, 81, 75] around mean (pivot = 84.71)
→ [75, 81, 69, 94, 86, 94, 94]

  ▸ Insertion sort (8–10): [69, 75, 81]  
  ▸ Insertion sort (11–14): [86, 94, 94, 94]

Final sorted array:
[3, 11, 13, 14, 17, 28, 31, 35, 69, 75, 81, 86, 94, 94, 94]
